# Movie_Recommender Project:

Two ways to build movie recommendation system:

	-> Content filtering based: personal watched movies similarites based on genre, interests, age etc
        
	-> Collaborative filtering based: trending, or other peoples who are similar with you...
	
        There are many movie recommendation algorithms, some popular ones include 
	
                -> Jaccard similarity, 
	
                -> Euclidean Distance
	
                -> Cosine Similarity
	
                -> Various Neural Networks

But we Content Filtering Based with Jaccard Similarity: Using Movies Genres

In this algo, we find similarites of your watched movies genre with unwatched movies genre, and recommend those who have high similarity...
